        My journey into ethical hacking began with a curiosity for understanding how systems work and a passion for cybersecurity. I am certified with CEH and OSCP, and I live by the hacker ethic: to use my skills for good, to protect and secure.
I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge to build a safer digital world.
